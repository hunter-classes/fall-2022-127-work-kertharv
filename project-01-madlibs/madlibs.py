# Extras
# Extra #1: Instead of specifying the sentences or story to convert, 
# write a story in a file and read it from your program. 
# Make sure to include the file in your repo and that your program reads it correctly.
# Extra #2: Pay attention to letter case. That is, if you replace a word at the beginning of a sentence, 
# it should be capitalized, otherwise, lowercase. 
# This is except in the case of proper nouns which should always be capitalized.
